				My name is Justin. I fell in love with photography when my parents got me a camera for my 16th birthday. I started to learn as much as I could about photography. I slowly saved up for different accessories such as a tripod and cable release so I could shoot the night sky. When I was a senior in high school I worked as a photo editor at fotofly. My favorite type of photography is star photography. I love going and exploring the great state of Utah away from all the light pollution. There's just something so peaceful about sitting underneath the night sky that I love.
